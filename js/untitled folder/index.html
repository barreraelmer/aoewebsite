        <h1>the bald man <br> and the fly</h1>
        <p>A Fly settled on the head of a Bald Man and bit him. In his eagerness to kill it, he hit himself a smart slap. But the Fly escaped, and said to him in derision, &ldquo;You tried to kill me for just one little bite; what will you do to yourself now, for the heavy smack you have just given yourself?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Oh, for that blow I bear no grudge,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for I never intended myself any harm; but as for you, you contemptible insect, who live by sucking human blood, I'd have borne a good deal more than that for the satisfaction of dashing the life out of you!&rdquo;
